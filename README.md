## 🧩 About Me

I’m an **AI Research Engineer at KakaoBank**, focusing on **post-training and optimization of large language models** that power real-world services for **26M+ active users**.  
My work explores how **reasoning, memory, and alignment** can be reimagined to make LLMs both *cognitively inspired* and *production-ready*.

Rather than scaling parameters alone, I study how models can **think more like humans** —  reasoning in parallel, integrating contextual memory, and aligning with human trust and intention.

## 🔭 Research Focus

### 🧠 Human-like Reasoning
Current LLMs reason **sequentially**, generating one token at a time.  \
Inspired by recent directions such as *Soft Token Reasoning* ([arXiv:2509.19170](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19170)), I’m exploring ways to enable **parallel and continuous inference** — models that can revise, aggregate, and evolve thoughts before producing answers.  \
This connects symbolic reasoning with diffusion-like latent dynamics, aiming for *human-parallel cognition*.

### ⚙️ Scalable Reasoning Systems
At KakaoBank, I lead **post-training and inference optimization** for **200B+ parameter LLMs**, building high-impact reasoning agents in financial and service domains.  

My work centers on:
- **Interleaved reasoning** combining function calls, memory, and tool use  
- **Multi-instruction reasoning**, enabling one instruction to branch into multiple sub-tasks  
- **Latency-optimized alignment**, balancing inference speed with reasoning depth  

### 🧬 Memory & Cognitive Modeling
Following earlier work on **episodic and structured memory (PREMem, 2025)**, I study how models can construct and manage internal memory representations — learning to **consolidate**, **forget**, and **contextualize** experiences across sessions. \
The goal is a reasoning loop that grounds decisions in structured, evolving memory.

### 🛡️ Trustworthy & Human-Aligned AI
Reasoning and memory must ultimately be *safe*.  
I develop and evaluate methods that ensure **consistency, transparency, and calibration** in model outputs — AI systems that *reflect before responding* and can *justify their reasoning processes*. \
This connects deeply to my broader pursuit: **aligning artificial reasoning with human cognition and ethics**.
